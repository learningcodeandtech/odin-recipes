        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Another classic cookie for the Christmas</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1  cups unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>Half cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1  cups ground almonds</li>
            <li>Half teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons raspberry jam, or as needed</li>
            <li>A third of a cup confectioners' sugar for decoration</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Beat butter and sugar in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy,
                2 to 3 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup flour, then ground almonds and cinnamon. Mix in 
                remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until well combined and dough stiffens a bit.
            </li>

            <li>Divide dough in half and form each half into a disc. Wrap each disc tightly in plastic 
                wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
            </li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
            </li>

            <li>Working with one dough disc at a time, roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 
                thickness of 1/8 inch. Use a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to cut as many circles from
                the dough as you can. Knead any leftover scraps of dough into a ball and roll it out again 
                into a 1/8-inch-thick sheet. Cut out more circles; you should have about 12 circles.
            </li>

            <li>Arrange dough circles on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between them. 
                Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator while you repeat Step 4 with remaining dough disc.
            </li>

            <li>Place the second batch of circles on the baking sheet, and cut out the center those 12 circles with 
                a 1/2-inch round cookie cutter.
            </li>

            <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until light brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer
                 to a wire rack to cool for 20 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Spread a thin coating of jam onto the bottom sides of the fully round cookies. Place a cut-out cookie on top 
                of each, pressing together to form a sandwich. Place back on the wire rack, and repeat to form 
                11 more cookies.</li>
            
            <li>Sift confectioners' sugar over the cookies, then spoon a dab of jam into the cut-out part of each cookie.</li>
